Feasibility & Guardrails

Apply these if/else checks to make sure plans are realistic and adapt to edge cases:

Closed Venue

If a museum or park is closed on that day → suggest a similar indoor option nearby.
Over-Budget Meal

If meal cost > user’s budget → switch to a cheaper restaurant of similar cuisine.
Too Far or Long Travel

Improve a rule so travel distances under 25 minutes are prioritized when a user says “short walks only.”

Weather Swap

If rain or cold season likely → make sure at least one indoor activity replaces outdoor ones.
Time Overrun

If total planned time > available hours → shorten lunch or pick a nearer stop.
Mobility Needs

If mobility limits noted → choose step-free, short-walk options and include breaks.
Dietary Needs

If user is vegan or has dietary constraints → ensure all meals match or swap with compliant ones.
Bookings

If activity usually needs a ticket → just remind the user to book it; never simulate bookings.
